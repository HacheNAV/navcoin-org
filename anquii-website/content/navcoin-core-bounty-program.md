Initiated by aguycalled, the Navcoin Core Bounty Program aims to encourage the decentralization of Navcoin Core development. There's 2 ways to claim a bounty through this program:

#### 1. Solve a GitHub issue

Issues that can be worked on to claim coins will be labelled with a special tag, and will be assigned to candidates on a first-come-first-served basis. The assignment will be handled on the GitHub issue itself. If you wish to work on a bounty, please comment on its GitHub issue and make sure that your claim has been acknowledged.

Bounties will be paid once the pull request is merged into master. The pull request must include the corresponding unit tests to be considered complete. The task's reward will be based on the issue's tag as per the below table:

Tag | Reward
:-- | :--
bounty-low | 100 NAV
bounty-medium | 500 NAV
bounty-high | 1000 NAV
bounty-xhigh | 2000 NAV

If you've noticed something that could be improved in Navcoin Core and that isn't already on the issues list, you can create an issue yourself and ask for it to be reviewed and assigned a bounty.

#### 2. Find a bug

Finding bugs in Navcoin Core is another way to earn NAV, and doesn't necessarily require programming knowledge. If you download and install the latest version of Navcoin Core, and you experience an issue when testing it on your system, you could be eligible to claim a bounty.

Vulnerabilities that has already been reported or is publicly known, will not be considered as a bounty. Neither will critical vulnerabilities (level 5 or more) that requires physical access to the device or MITM techniques. Payment will be done based on the bug's type and severity according to the table below:

Type | Reward
:-- | :--
Visual Glitches | 100 NAV
Minor UX Issues | 300 NAV
Major UX Issues | 600 NAV
Local Client Crashes | 1000 NAV
DoS Attacks | 2500 NAV
Network Isolation Attacks | 4000 NAV
Consensus Vulnerabilities | 5000 NAV
Generation of Coins | 10000 NAV
Theft of Funds | 15000 NAV

If you've discovered a critical bug in Navcoin Core, we hope that you treat it with discretion and disclose it to us responsibly. We'll then work with you to resolve the bug and ensure that your bounty can be claimed.
