Before backing up your wallet, make sure to encrypt it by following the steps outlined [here](#encrypt-wallet).  

To take a backup of your wallet, you must first ensure that the *Navcoin Core* application is shutdown. With that done, you should [locate the Navcoin data directory](#locate-data), then take a copy of the `wallet.dat` file, from within the `navcoin4` folder, and store it at a secure place. An example of such place could be an external hard drive or USB stored in a secure location, or otherwise within an encrypted file storage service.

**Note**: It's good practice to store backups of your wallet at multiple locations to avoid loosing it over the potential failure of one (e.g. having a single hard drive or USB that malfunctions).
