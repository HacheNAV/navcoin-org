You can choose to redirect all of your stakes or only part of them, to a single address or multiple ones that you specify, and you can do so to any address of your choosing, e.g. own of your own, an address held by someone else, or even the address of our network's decentralized community fund. To redirect your stakes, open the *Navcoin Core* application and choose *Set up staking rewards* under *Settings* from within the toolbar. You may also choose to simply click the *Set up staking rewards* button located on the home page of the *Navcoin Core* application, as depicted below.

With this done, you'll be presented with the option to configure the redirection of stakes for each of your addresses that contains a balance, by selecting them individually from the dropdown menu. With one of your staking addresses selected in the dropdown menu, you can click *Add* to specify a custom address to forward a certain percentage of your stakes to. You'll also see a number of presets available to you if you wish to donate stakes to the developers of the Navcoin Core team, the bounty programs, or the community fund.

The *Default* configuration in the dropdown menu is used for addresses that hasn't been set up with a configuration of its own. Once you've configured your stakes, make sure to click the *Save* button, and it should take effect right away with no need to restart the *Navcoin Core* application.
