Before encrypting your wallet, it's vital that you create a strong passphrase to encrypt your wallet with and that you store a backup of it at a secure place. Using a password manager that can generate and store long and secure passwords is highly recommended.

**Note**: If you lose the passphrase to your encrypted wallet, you'll not be able to access the funds of your wallet anymore.

Open the *Navcoin Core* application, and then choose *Encrypt wallet* under *Settings* from within the toolbar. You'll be prompted to enter a secure passphrase. Once done, your wallet will restart, and your `wallet.dat` file will have become encrypted.

**Note**: It's highly recommend to back up your wallet. Click [here](#backup-wallet) to find out more.
