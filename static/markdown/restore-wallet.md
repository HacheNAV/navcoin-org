Before trying to restore your wallet from a backup, make sure that your node is running the [latest version](#update-node) of the *Navcoin Core* application, and that it's shutdown momentarily. Apart from this, make sure to have your `wallet.dat` file ready, as you'll need it as part of the next steps.

To restore your wallet from a backup, you should first [locate the Navcoin data directory](#locate-data). If you see an existing file named `wallet.dat` within this directory, then rename it to `old_wallet.dat`. You can now simply copy and paste your original `wallet.dat` file into this same directory, and then launch the *Navcoin Core* application.  

**Note**: If the wallet named `old_wallet.dat` contains no funds, then feel free to delete it. Otherwise, make sure to back it up. Find out more about backing up your wallet [here](#backup-wallet).
